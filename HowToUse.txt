How To Use:
1) Choose A Skript
2) Choose a name for the plugin
3) If you want, you can get a custom skript .jar to get an older version running 
(currently buggy, might not work)
4) If you want, you can get a custom SKQuery .jar to get an older version running
(again, this feature is sort of buggy so it might not work)
5) Once everything is done, click "Build Jar" and enjoy!
